THIS MASTER COLLABORATION AGREEMENT (MCA) the ("Agreement"), effective {{Effective_Date}}, is entered into by and between {{Contracting_Company}} ("Company") and a team of consultant ("Consultants", or collectively with Company "Parties") to seek a collaborative relationship that benefits both Parties and provides fair rewards for each Party, based on the risk and investment in labor, expertise, intellectual property, and capital undertaken by each.

The Parties intend that their collaboration accomplish the goals defined by mutually agreed statements of work.

1. TERM
The term of this Agreement will be from the {{Effective_Date}} until terminated as provided in Section 15. (the "Term").

2. SCOPE OF SERVICES
Company and Consultants hereby agree to collaborate on projects and goals, pursuant to statements of work or work order (“Work Order” or “WO”) to this Agreement. Each Work Order shall describe the respective contribution and services of each Party. Services provided by any Party under this Agreement are referred to as the "Services." For purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties when engaged to perform the Services is the “Performing Party” and while engaging the other of the Parties is the “Requesting Party.”

All Work Orders under this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by both Parties and shall be incorporated into, and governed by, this Agreement. Each Work Order should set forth, among other things:
(a) a description of the Services to be performed;
(b) the responsibilities of the Parties;
(c) an estimated timeline;
(d) project milestones and any deliverables to be created for Company (the "Deliverables") and (e) a budget (“Budget”) for the Services.

If a Party requests a change to a Work Order, the Parties shall execute a written change order (the "Change Order"), which shall identify in reasonable detail:
(a) a complete summary of the change requested;
(b) the impact on scheduled completion, if any;
(c) the impact on the Deliverable and the Services, if any; and
(d) the impact on costs and expenses, if any.

For the avoidance of doubt, all Change Orders are subject to the written approval of Company and Consultants. 2 A request by a Requesting Party to a Performing Party to perform an ongoing function or accomplish a specific goal becomes a Work Order once accepted by the Performing Party, whether or not specifying Deliverables or Budget. Likewise, a counteroffer to the request by the Performing Party to the Requesting Party becomes a Work Order once accepted by the Requesting Party.

An initial Work Order for “Training & Onboarding Workshop” is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

2.1 PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Each party will take the Mutual Integrity Pledge to mediate the Goal Stick and any concerns or disputes that may arise between the Parties. This pledge and its accountability protocols are licensed from Measurable Integrity Foundation and reproduced here, with all rights reserved, for convenience:

I, {{Your_Name}}, pledge to honor my word as my bond and support others as equals in acting with integrity. I accept that dishonoring my word and this pledge will result in a breach of integrity as recorded on my reputation slate until I measure the impact and make amends.

Parties will confirm and record these pledges during the Kickoff Call explained in Exhibit A.

3. COMPENSATION
Compensation shall be paid by the Requesting Party as specified in the Work Order under which work is performed.

Unless specified in the Work Order, invoices shall be payable within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the Performing Party’s invoice unless disputed in writing within 15 calendar days of receipt. Payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the address provided by Performing Party.

Expenses of the Performing Party for performance under a Work Order shall be reimbursed by the Requesting Party if included on the Performing Party’s invoice for the period in which the expenses were incurred, subject to limitations in the applicable Work Order

4. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between the Parties. Each Party shall, at all times during the term of this Agreement, perform the duties and responsibilities herein without any control by the other Party. Either Party may realize a profit or loss in connection with performing the services. Either Party may render similar services for the benefit of others. Neither Party is an agent of the other Party and is not authorized to make any representation, contract, or contract commitment on behalf of the other Party.

5. CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidential Information shall be treated as confidential according to the terms of the Mutual Ecosystem Nondisclosure Agreement (MENDA) attached hereto as Exhibit B.

6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
“Intellectual Property” means inventions, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property preserved in a tangible medium, whether solely or jointly, by the Parties arising from work performed under this Agreement. Ownership of Intellectual Property shall be determined according to applicable United States law.

No assignment, license, or other transfer of Intellectual Property is made by this Agreement. Each Party shall retain ownership and control of its own Intellectual Property, in the absence of a valid and separately executed instrument of transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Performing Party provides a solution for the Requesting Party that the Requesting Party implements without prior written disclosure from the Performing Party that a license or other transfer of Intellectual Property is or may be required for continued implementation of the solution without infringement by the Requesting Party, and the Requesting Party is otherwise in compliance with this Agreement at the time the solution is provided, then Performing Party shall grant to the Requesting Party an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to the Intellectual Property, and in the absence of an express license, the Performing Party shall be deemed to have constructively granted such license as of the time that the Performing Party first provided the solution.

7. WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY
Pares warrant that they shall use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out their duties in accordance with applicable federal, state, and other national or international regulations and laws. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 8, EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMIT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR TITLE WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES HEREUNDER. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 9 (Indemnification) BELOW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PERFORMING PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE REQUESTING PARTY (OR THE ASSOCIATED INDEMNIFIED PARTIES AS DEFINED THEREIN) FOR ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, EQUITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 9 (Indemnification) BELOW, THE PERFORMING PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE REQUESTING PARTY (OR THE ASSOCIATED INDEMNIFIED PARTIES) UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY THE REQUESTING PARTY TO THE PERFORMING PARTY DURING THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND $1,000.

8. INDEMNIFICATION
Parties shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other party, and its members, directors, officers, employees and agents (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all third party claims, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), directly or indirectly, wholly or partially arising from or in connection with any negligent, gross negligent or intentional tortious act or omission of Bitt or its employees or agents, in performing the Services and performing its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such claims, liabilities, losses or expenses arise from or in connection with the negligence, gross negligence, or intentional tortious act or omission of the Indemnified Parties.

9. FORCE MAJEURE
Any delay or failure of a Party hereto to perform its obligations hereunder will be excused if and to the extent that it was caused by an event or occurrence beyond such Party’s reasonable control and without its fault or negligence (“Force Majeure”). Force Majeure includes, but is not limited to, acts of God, actions by any government authority (whether valid or invalid), fires, floods, windstorms, explosions, riots, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, acts of terrorism, or court injunction or order. A Party claiming Force Majeure must provide the other Party with written notice of such delay (including the anticipated duration of the delay) within ten days of the occurrence of Force Majeure. If the delay lasts more than 30 days, or if the Party claiming Force Majeure does not provide adequate assurances to the other Party that the delay will cease within 30 days, such other Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Party claiming Force Majeure.

10. DISPUTES
In the event one Party believes the other Party to be in breach of this Agreement (“Dispute”), the aggrieved Party shall notify the other Party or its counsel (“Notice”) of the alleged breach or violation, and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve or clarify the Dispute (“Negotiation”). In the event the parties are unable to cooperatively resolve the Dispute, they shall attempt, in good faith, to mediate the matter in a mutually acceptable location (“Mediation”), engaging the services of a mediator familiar with subject matter at issue and acceptable to both Parties. Applicable mediation fees shall be borne equally by the Parties.

If the Negotiation or Mediation does not resolve the Dispute within 60 calendar days of when the filing Party first proposes Mediation, and the Parties do not otherwise agree, the mediator selected by the Parties shall select a neutral arbitrator to arbitrate the Dispute according to a process defined by the arbitrator, with costs of arbitration shared equally by the Parties. However, if the non-filing Party refuses or declines to cooperate in Mediation, the filing Party may select any reasonable and neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages or other remedies enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Except to enforce a valid arbitration award, or to prevent irreparable harm as provided below, no Party shall sue the other Party in any court of law.

The requirement of Mediation and Negotiation may be waived upon mutual written consent of the Parties. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive relief against a Party related to the acts or omissions of such Party that breach this Agreement and cause or are likely to cause irreparable harm to the other Party, without the requirement of Mediation or Negotiation.

11. RECORDS
Unless otherwise within a Work Order, the Performing Party shall retain records, including but not limited to accounts, notes, work product, code and data, related to each Work Order for a reasonable time period of not less than three years, subject to applicable regulatory requirement(s).

12. APPLICABLE LAW
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah and of the United States, without regard to the conflict of laws rules of the applicable jurisdiction.

13. NOTICE
